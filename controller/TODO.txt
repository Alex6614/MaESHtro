-Get client to send its current assigned gateway to server? Because right now that check won't work right








X Implement logic where if you to switch gateway, delete default routes

X Handle errors

X Put in 5 second sleep before send

Start making the controller's graph that will determine routing and gateway suggestions
	X Dynamic gateway: First make sure client sticks with a gateway that works for it and not switch between two possibilities unless its original gateway goes down

	Multihop: Create a graph


-In server while loop, every 100 iterations check if you've gotten a connection from each node. If not, delete that node and all instances of it in the graph
-Add node in dict with empty set
