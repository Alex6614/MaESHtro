To find devices on the network:
    1) figure out your IP address (most devices: ifconfig - then grab the ipv4 address)
        --- Referred to as <IP_ADDRESS> from now on
    2) run the command $ sudo nmap -sn <IP_ADDRESS>/24
        --- the /24 is to let it scan all the open ports on that IP
    3) A pi will appear in the results as
            Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.197
            Host is up (0.0046s latency).

TCPDUMP to read capture all INCOMING packets
    $ tcpdump -i en0 ip -X dst host <IP_ADDRESS>

TCPDUMP to read capture all OUTGOING packets
    $ tcpdump -i en0 ip -X src host <IP_ADDRESS>

To capture 100 packets on current network and save them
    $ sudo tcpdump -c 100 -w ~/Desktop/capture.pcap

PINGING JUST ONE PACKET
    $ ping <IP_TO_PING> -c 1
