First issue we ran into:
    The Pi with the WiFi dongle would not detect the WiFi at all (said no interfaces available)
    FIX:
        run $ sudo dhcpcd -q -d
    WHY:
        The issue was that dhcpcd was not booted up, this forced it to start running again.

STEPS:
- Add route (to Katherine's computer on Nour's network)
            $ sudo ip route add default via 10.0.0.133
- go to sockets folder
            $ cd ~/MaESHtro/sockets/
- run the script that connects to google and attempts to initiate an HTTP request
            $ python test.c
